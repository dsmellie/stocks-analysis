# Analysis of Green Stock Returns Refactored

## Overview of Project
This project analyzed the returns of a number of green stocks in 2017 and 2018.

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve's parents invest in green stocks. 

## Analysis and Challenges
To analyze these returns I compared the starting and ending prices of stock over the year and determined the percentage change. One challenge was refactoring the code so that it could be used in the future.  The main challenge I encountered in refactoring the code was ensuring the data was properly output and making sure to use the correct index for the arrays I created. 

## Results
The first result of note is that only two stocks had a positive performance in 2018, ENPH and RUN as shown below.

As these stocks also performed positively in 2017, they may represent good investments. However, several stocks in 2017 seriously outperformed RUN. DQ, ENPH, FSLR, and SEDG all had returns over 100% for 2017 while RUN only had a 5.5% return as seen below.
